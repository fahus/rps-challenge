# Rock, Paper, Scissors :fist: :raised_hand: :v:



### Task
This is the  third weekend challenge at Makers Academy. It allowed  me to practice building simple web applications and follow an effective debugging process for web applications. For this challenge I managed to successfully complete all the User Stories, but if given more time I would like to practice with CSS and HTML to style the game better.


### User Stories
```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

### Acceptance criteria
* The marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
* The marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
* The marketeer can choose one option
* The game will choose a random option
* A winner will be declared


### How to run this program
* Clone this repo
* Run 'gem install bundle'
* When the installation completes, run 'bundle'
* From the command line, run ruby app.rb and visit 'http://localhost:4567'


### Skills I learned from this Challenge
* Structuring the code for apps that have user interaction and visual output
* Using Sinatra
* Testing apps that have user interaction and visual output
* Tracing data between the browser and server


### What I would like to improve/fix
* Implement multi-player mode so that the user does not have to play against the computer
* Refactor some elements of my code e.g the long conditional statement. Instead I would use a hash to map over the rules of the game
* Improve the visual output
